# DiceRoller
A simple program that allows a user to 'roll' any number of dice with a user-set number of sides. This program makes use of the java.util.Scannner and java.util.Random libraries. 
The program limits dice to by physically possible - that is, they must have an even number of sides.
The program loops back to the beginning once the dice are rolled, but the user is given the option to exit instead.
